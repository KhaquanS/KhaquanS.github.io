I am a CS senior at LUMS and a Machine Learning Researcher at Centre for Speech and Language Technologies (CSaLT).

I revel in contributing towards the deployment of large networks on small GPUs so that more people can enjoy the wonders of scaled up nerual nets.

## My Interests

- **Model Compression:**
Pruning, Distillation, Quantisation and PEFT methods among other techniques. 

- **Representation Learning:**
Methods ranging from the classic word2vec to the modern CLIP embeddings.

- **Retrieval Augmented Systems:**
Building custom RAG pipelines and Agentic frameworks to accomplish complex reasoning tasks (refer to the DataSci Chatbot project in my [Resume](files/resume.pdf))

- **Modern DNN Architectures:**
SOTA architectures such as MoE models, Diffusion Models, and more recently hybrid state space models such as Mamba.

- **General Stuff:**
Topics in Quantitative Finance (reading up on various intuitive derivations of Black-Scholes is a guilty pleasure) and more recently Theoretical Neuroscience.

## What's Ahead for Me

In the upcoming Fall Semester, I will be preoccupied with the following:

- TAing the Machine Learning Course at LUMS (CS 535).
- Writing a paper hopefully to be submitted at ICLR '25.
- Enjoying the Advanced Topics in ML course that will mainly revolve around Represenation Learning (yay!)
- And last but not the least, sharing my learnings with you all!
